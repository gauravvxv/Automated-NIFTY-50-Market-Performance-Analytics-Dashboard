## Tech Stack:
Python • yFinance • SQL • Azure • Power BI • Windows Task Scheduler

## Business Problem

Investors and market analysts need to track and evaluate the performance of NIFTY 50 stocks to understand market trends, returns, and stock-wise movement. However, analyzing 5 years of daily data across 50 companies manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, limiting timely insights into top performers, underperformers, and overall market behavior.

An automated analytics solution is required to consolidate historical stock data, compute key performance metrics such as monthly returns and volatility, and deliver insights through an interactive dashboard that supports faster, data-driven market analysis.
