## Tech Stack:
Python • yFinance • SQL • Azure • Power BI • Windows Task Scheduler

## Business Problem

Investors and analysts need to monitor the performance of NIFTY 50 stocks over time to understand market trends, returns, and stock-wise performance. However, analyzing 5 years of daily stock data across 50 companies manually is time-consuming and inefficient, making it difficult to identify top performers, underperformers, and overall market movement.

There is a need for an automated analytics solution that consolidates historical stock data, calculates monthly performance metrics, and presents insights through an interactive dashboard to support data-driven market analysis.
