## Tech Stack:
Python • yFinance • SQL • Azure • Power BI • Windows Task Scheduler

## Business Problem

Investors and market analysts need to track and evaluate the performance of NIFTY 50 stocks over time to understand market trends, returns, and stock-wise movement. However, analyzing daily market data for 50 companies from January 2021 to the current date manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, making it difficult to identify top performers, underperformers, and overall market behavior in a timely manner.

There is a need for an automated analytics solution that continuously consolidates historical and latest stock data, calculates key performance metrics such as monthly returns and volatility, and presents insights through an interactive dashboard to support faster, data-driven market analysis.
